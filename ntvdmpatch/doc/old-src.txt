Hot to compile
==============

Here is a short howto on how to compile this:
Please be aware, that the build environment currently only works on
Windows XP 32bit.
1) Prepare your machine according the the OpenNT project build instructions:
   a) Unpack contents of old-src directory from 
      old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z to your working directory
      You do not need to extract the .svn folder in it
   b) Create directory nt\public\sdk in your working directory and 
      unpack the contentes of old-sdk directory from 
      old-sdk.trunk_r57.20150728.7z to it.
      You do not need to extract the .svn folder in it
   c) Ensure that you don't have w: drive already assigned and then
      setup w: drive to point to the working directory by typing
      SUBST W: .
      inside the working directory and then switch to W:
2) Now extract the ntvdmpatch directory from this source repository
   to the root of W: drive 
3) Run the patch.cmd file inside the ntvdmpatch directory to patch 
   the sourcecode tree accordingly
3a)If you want, you can apply the updates now (see next topic)
4) Run zSHtst.cmd to enter build shell where you then type:
   a) bld-ntos.cmd 
      to build base components that are required for building NTVDM.
      errors after build can be ignored
   b) bld.cmd 
      to build now patched NTVDM
      "Build error" in the end isn't a problem as long as ntvdm.exe
      is built.
5) Run mkrelease.bat to create a redistributable package in the
   release\ subdirectory
6) Pack release-Directory as installation package for target machine.

There is a youtube video available that documents compilation steps:

Youtube-user enderman also made a video about it:

Sourcecode updates
==================
NTVDM from NT4 sourcecode is quite dated. i.e. it lacks Long Filename (LFN)
support and other stuff that got implemented in newer versions of NTVDM.
At the time of writig, I didn't have the modern NTVDM sourcecode available, 
so I tried to reconstruct some updates which are located in the updates 
directory. I found out too late, that MINNT source tree actually contained
all these updates.
To apply the a specific update, you must run the patch.cmd in the 
appropriate update-directory. It is assumed that you apply the updates in
the order of the directory numbers to ensure that the paches fit to each
other. 
A description of the updates is documented in doc\updates.txt
