The experimental folder contains some not-ready-for-production patches and 
enhancements by me, that can be further developed and may be of use in the 
future. You are invited to experiment with it and fix them for production use.

Here is a very short explanation:

cvidc-new
---------
The CVIDC interface is a little inefficient, as it is basically generated 
C-code from EDL-code. Therefore it has the following disadvantages:

 - The code is barely readable and hard to understand, as we don't have the
   EDL-files it originates from.
 - The code is SLOWER than it could be, as all registers are global variables,
   which cause a lot of unneccessary instructions that prevent the compiler
   from optimizing certain functionality by using local registers.
 - The code gets called very often, therefore optimization may be useful.

Therefore the generated code of every function has been analyzed and 
hand-crafted together into a rewrite. The interface plugs cleanly into NTVDM
and therefore to use it, one just has to link to cvidc-new instead of
cvidc to use the reimplementation.
We rely on the preprocessor a lot to generate the code.

Attention: The code currently is BUGGY and not working as it should yet, 
therefore it is just experimental until we write complete tests that can test
old CVIDC-code and this implementation and compare the results to find buggy
functions in the implementation. 
The performance gain also isn't as good as I had expected, but feel free
to correct it. Still work-in-progress.
