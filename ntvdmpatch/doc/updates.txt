001-sb20	-	Adds the lousy Soundblaster 2.0 emulation of NTVDM starting with Windows XP
002-demlfn	-	Long filename support for DOS emulation (71h functions of INT21h)
003-romemu	-	Patch for the sole purpose of source reconstruction, not really 
			needed for NTVDMX64 build (as it uses ROM emulation anyway for CCPU): 
			Possibility to use ROM emulation in NTVDM when using Intel Graphics on ARCx86 CPUs.
