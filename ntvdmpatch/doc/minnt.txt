About MinNT
===========
Stephanos Ioannidis, who thankfully gave us the build environment for NT
and the OpenNT project also created a NT build system that just features a 
minimal NT core to build Project in the subtree of NT, which has the following
advantages over the original NT build system

 * It contains a more recent NTVDM sourcecode version!
 * It also operates on newer Windows Versions than XP, thus it can be used
   for building on the target machine
 * The newer source is multilingual and allows you building non-English
   NTVDM versions

As there are significant advantages in using this build system, I made some
patches for it to actually get it working with NTVDMx64.
As it lacks some libraries/headers, you still need the old NT4 sourcecode
to pull in some required dependencies.

As the sourcecode version is different, NTVDMx64 patches need to be ported to
this sourcecode version. This is currently work in progress.
This document will be enhanced as soon as patches are ported.

Requirements
============
 * MinNT repository with NTVDM with latest commits as of Apr 16, 2017 
   (q160765803-minint4-85fac4faadc7)
   opennt.net site contains some hints on where to find it.
 * Windows NT4 repository old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z
 * Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0 
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
 * Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 (ISO) 
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442
 * NTOSBE-master build environment
   https://github.com/stephanosio/NTOSBE


Setup MINNT build environment
=============================

1) Place the following directories in your build directory:

 * Extract NTOSBE-master
 * Create minnt directory and extract contents of minnt (q160765803-minint4-85fac4faadc7) to it
 * Extract our ntvdmpatch repository 

You now have:

  minnt
  NTOSBE-master
  ntvdmpatch

2) Download required SDK ISOs and old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z and place them in
   ntvdmpatch\minnt\work

 * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
 * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442
 * Google old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z 

You now have in ntvdmpatch\minnt\work:

  GRMSDK_EN_DVD.iso
  GRMWDK_EN_7600_1.ISO
  old-src.trunk.r687.20150728.7z

3) Go to ntvdmpatch\minnt\ and run prepare.cmd
minntfix directory will now be prepared with the missing files that need to be 
added to minnt but cannot be supplied by me due to legal reasons.

4) In ntvdmpatch\minnt\ now run patch.cmd to create a working minnt repository

5) Go to NTOSBE-master directory and run sizzle_minnt.cmd

6) As you can see, on first run, you need to now execute buildrepoidw.cmd on 
   OpeNT shell
